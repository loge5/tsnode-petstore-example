# Unit-Tests

Used Modules:
* https://mochajs.org/

npm run-script cover
```

# Development

## Style Guide

We use this linter: https://github.com/standard/ts-standard

Auto-Format:

`npm run-script format`

## Commit Messages

We use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version), please format your commit messages like this:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

1. `fix`: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning).
2. `feat`: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning).
3. `BREAKING CHANGE`: a commit that has the text BREAKING CHANGE: at the beginning of its optional body or footer section introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in semantic versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
4. Others: commit types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, and others.
